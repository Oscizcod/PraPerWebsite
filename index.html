        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This website serves as a personal tracker of all the <a href="https://www.github.com/Oscizcod" target="_blank">coding projects</a> I'm involved in. These range from personal to group-based and even open source. My main interest is in developing technologies that aid people in living a more holistic lifestyle. I believe that is both impossible and foolish to try and revert our current society to pre-technological times while realising that with the advancements we've enjoyed, there has been other aspects of our lives that have been eroded.</p>
